;;;; Macro expansion.

;;;
;;; Function MACROEXPAND.
;;;
;;; The HyperSpec says that this function repeatedly calls
;;; MACROEXPAND-1 until the second return value is false, so that is
;;; what we do too.
;;;
;;; However, that is not what the compiler should do.  The reason is
;;; that MACROEXPAND-1 might very well return another macro form that
;;; in addition has a compiler macro associated with it.  In that
;;; case, it would be inappropriate (though technically not "wrong")
;;; for the compiler to call MACROEXPAND-1 again.  Instead, it should
;;; apply the compiler macro first and then expand again.  In fact,
;;; the application of the compiler macro function might return
;;; something other than a macro form. It could also be the case that
;;; what MACROEXPAND-1 returns is NOT a macro form, but it is a
;;; function-call form with a compiler macro associated with it, and
;;; the compiler macro might return a macro form.
;;;
;;; For reasons mentioned in the previous paragraph, the compiler does
;;; not call macroexpand at all, but instead a function called
;;; FULLY-EXPAND-FORM defined below.
