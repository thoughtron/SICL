;;; Expanders for macros CASE, ECASE, CCASE.
;;;
;;; A normal CASE/ECASE/CCASE clause has the form (KEYS FORM*) where
;;; KEYS is a designator for a list of objects, except that for CASE,
;;; the symbols T and OTHERWISE may not be used as such.  Instead,
;;; when T or OTHERWISE are present in the CAR of a clause, then they
;;; do not designate a list of objects, and instead that clause is an
;;; otherwise-clause.  For ECASE and CCASE, T and OTHERWISE can be
;;; used as as designators for lists, and they then designate the
;;; singleton list containing itself.
;;;
;;; In the glossary of the HyperSpec (under "list designator"), we
;;; learn that a list designator is ether a non-NIL atom, in which
;;; case the denoted list is the list containing that one atom, or
;;; else it is a proper list, and the denoted list is that list.  In
;;; particular, this means that if NIL (or equivalently `()') is used
;;; in the CAR of a CASE clause, then the denoted list is the empty
;;; list and NOT the list containing NIL.  Thus, to obtain the
;;; singleton list containing NIL, the user has to use `(NIL)'.

;;; Take a list of keys (known to be a proper list), and the name of a
;;; variable, and produce a list of forms (eql <variable> key).
