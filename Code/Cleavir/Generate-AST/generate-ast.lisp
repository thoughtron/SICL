;;;
;;; Managing top-level forms.
;;;
;;; We need to be able to test whether a form is a top-level form or
;;; not.  A few special forms (LOCALLY, MACROLET, SYMBOL-MACROLET)
;;; preserve this property in that if the special form itself is a
;;; top-level form, then the body of the special form is also a
;;; top-level form.  For all other forms, any subform of the form is
;;; not considered a top-level form.

;;; The reason for the following somewhat twisted logic is that we
;;; want to avoid having to explicitly set *SUBFORMS-ARE-TOP-LEVEL-P*
;;; to false in every method EXCEPT the ones for LOCALLY, MACROLET,
;;; and SYMBOL-MACROLET.  This logic allows us to add some code ONLY
;;; to these special forms in order to indicate that they preserve the
;;; top-level property.
;;;
;;; The way this logic works is as follows: We define a second
;;; variable named *CURRENT-FORM-IS-TOP-LEVEL-P*.  This variable holds
;;; the value of *SUBFORMS-ARE-TOP-LEVEL-P* as it was before CONVERT was
;;; called, and this is the variable that we actually test in order to
;;; determine whether a form is a top-level form.  To obtain that, we
;;; define an :AROUND method on CONVERT that binds
;;; *CURRENT-FORM-IS-TOP-LEVEL-P* to the value of *SUBFORMS-ARE-TOP-LEVEL-P*
;;; for the duration of the invocation of the primary method on
;;; CONVERT, and that also binds *SUBFORMS-ARE-TOP-LEVEL-P* to false.  Any
;;; recursive invocation of CONVERT will thus automatically see the
;;; value of *CURRENT-FORM-IS-TOP-LEVEL-P* as false.  The methods for
;;; LOCALLY, MACROLET, and SYMBOL-MACROLET set
;;; *CURRENT-FORM-IS-TOP-LEVEL-P* to true so that when they
;;; recursively call CONVERT, then this true value will be the value
;;; of *CURRENT-FORM-IS-TOP-LEVEL-P*.  I hope this explanation makes
;;; sense.

;;; This variable is true if and only if the current form is a
;;; top-level form.
(defvar *current-form-is-top-level-p*)

;;; This variable is true if and only if the subforms of the current
;;; form are top-level forms.

;;; CONVERT-CONSTANT is called when a constant is found, either in the

;;;
;;; Obviously, Cleavir can not know a priori neither whether the
;;; constant can be represented as an immediate value, nor can it know
;;; in that case what the corresponding immediate representation is.
;;; For that reason, we first call the generic function named
;;; CONVERT-CONSTANT-TO-IMMEDIATE with the constant value and the
;;; environment.  The function CONVERT-CONSTANT-TO-IMMEDIATE may
;;; return NIL, meaning that this constant does not have a
;;; representation as an immediate value, or it may return a
;;; possibly-negative integer which is taken to be the representation
;;; of the constant as an immediate machine word.  A default method is
;;; provided that always returns NIL.

;;; The general method for processing the lambda list is as follows:
;;; We use recursion to process the remaining lambda list.  Before the
;;; recursive call, we add the current parameters to the environment
;;; that we pass to the recursive call.  The call returns two values:
;;; the AST that was built and modified lambda list, containing the
;;; lambda list keywords, and the lexical variables that were
;;; introduced.  The exception is that processing &AUX entries does
;;; not return any lambda list, because it will always be empty.
;;;
;;; The reason we do it this way is that, if a parameter turns out to
;;; be a special variable, the entire rest of the lambda list and
;;; function body must be executed with this variable bound.  The AST
;;; configuration for expressing that situation is that the AST for
;;; computing the rest of the lambda list and the body must be a child
;;; of a BIND-AST that indicates that the special variable should be
;;; bound.  This recursive method makes sure that the child exists
;;; before the BIND-AST is created.
;;;
;;; The parameter DSPECS that is used in several functions is a list
;;; of canonicalized declaration specifiers.  This list is used to
;;; determine whether a variable is declared special.

;;; This class is used to describe the body of a function.  It
;;; contains the declaration specifiers that apply to the body as a
;;; whole, the forms of the body and information about a possible
;;; BLOCK that the body code should be wrapped in.  The main reason
