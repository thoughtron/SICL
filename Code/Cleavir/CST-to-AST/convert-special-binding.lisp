(cl:in-package #:cleavir-cst-to-ast)

;;; We need to build a CST corresponding to the following expression:
;;;
;;; `(cleavir-primop:call-with-variable-bound
;;;   ',variable
;;;   (cleavir-primop:ast ,value-ast)
;;;   (lambda () (cleavir-primop:ast ,next-ast)))
;;;
;;; The problem here is that we don't have VARIABLE, only the
;;; corresponding CST, and we do not want to lose the source
;;; information of the variable.  So we construct an ordinary Common
;;; Lisp list of CSTs, and then we convert that to a CST.
