;;; Instruction MULTIPLE-TO-FIXED-INSTRUCTION.
;;;
;;; This instruction takes a single input of type VALUES-LOCATION and
;;; a list of outputs that are LEXICAL-LOCATIONs.  The purpose is to
;;; assign multiple values to one or more ordinary lexical locations.
;;; The assignment is done so that if fewer ordinary lexical locations
;;; are required than there are values contained in the
;;; VALUES-LOCATION, then the remaining values are ignored, and if
;;; more ordinary lexical locations are required than there are values
;;; contained in the VALUES-LOCATION, then the remaining ordinary
;;; lexical locations are assigned to NIL.

;;; kept with the output.

;;; as input instead of a lexical one, and correspondingly, a
;;; (decomposed) values type instead of a single-value type.
;;; A separate instruction is useful because values locations can
;;; have an unknown or varying number of values.
