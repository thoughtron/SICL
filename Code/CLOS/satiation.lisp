;;; Satiate a generic function.
;;;
;;; We assume we have a standard generic function.  We also assume
;;; that the specializers of each method are classes as opposed to EQL
;;; specializers.  Finally, we assume that the generic function uses
;;; the standard method combination.
;;;
;;; For each primary method of the generic function, compute all the
;;; combinations of argument classes that would make it applicable.
;;; Compute a unique list of such combinations of classes.  For each
;;; combination, do the same thing as is done if the generic function
;;; were actually called with those classes, i.e., compute the
;;; applicable methods and the effective method and load up the call
;;; history.  Finally, compute and set the discriminating function.

;;; Return all descendants of a class, including the class itself.
