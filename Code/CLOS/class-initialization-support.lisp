;;; Implement class initialization according to the section of the
;;; AMOP entitled "Initialization of Class Metaobjects".

;;; For :DIRECT-DEFAULT-INITARGS, the AMOP says that it defaults to
;;; the empty list when the class metaobject is being initialized.  We
;;; take that to implicitly imply that when the class metaobject is
;;; reinitialized as opposed to initialized, there is no default for
;;; this initialization argument, so that if it is not given, the old
;;; value is retained.  The AMOP furthermore says that this argument
;;; is a list of canonicalized default initialization arguments.
;;; While canonicalization is accomplished directly in the DEFCLASS
;;; macro (it has to, because a closure needs to be created there to
;;; get the lexical environment right), it is possible to create a
;;; class directly by calling MAKE-INSTANCE.  For that reason, we must
;;; still check that the :DIRECT-DEFAULT-INITARGS, is a canonicalized
;;; list.

;;; For :DIRECT-SLOTS, the situation is more complicated.  The
;;; DEFCLASS macro provides us with the canonicalized
;;; slot-descriptions, but it can not create the
;;; DIRECT-SLOT-DEFINITION metaobjects, because the class to be used
;;; for those metaobjects is determined later.  During initialization
;;; and reinitialization, there is therefore some further processing
;;; that needs to be done.  Again, the AMOP says that it defaults to
;;; the empty list when the class metaobject is being initialized.
;;; Again, we take that to implicitly imply that when the class
;;; metaobject is reinitialized as opposed to initialized, there is no
;;; default for this initialization argument, so that if it is not
;;; given, the old value is retained.

;;; Provide an :AFTER method on INITIALIZE-INSTANCE to be used when
;;; class metaobjects are instantiated.  As the AMOP says, we have to
;;; provide appropriate default values for the superclasses and we
;;; have to link the superclasses to this new class metaobject.  We
;;; also have to create slot metaobjects from the slot property list
;;; provided to initialize-instance.

;;; The AMOP is not quite clear when it comes to restrictions on
;;; portable programs with respect to methods on INITIALIZE-INSTANCE
;;; and REINITIALIZE-INSTANCE.  It explicitly allows for portable
;;; programs to define :BEFORE and :AFTER methods on
;;; INITIALIZE-INSTANCE, so one might think that the implementation
;;; could not define an :AFTER method on INITIALIZE-INSTANCE because
;;; it could be overridden by a perfectly good portable program.  But
;;; then, when reading the restriction about :AROUND methods (it says
;;; it must be EXTENDING, not OVERRIDING) it seems clear that the
;;; :BEFORE, :AFTER, and :AROUND methods that a portable program is
;;; allowed to define specialize for STRICT SUBCLASSES of the standard
;;; classes, so we are safe if we define an :AFTER method in
;;; INITIALIZE-INSTANCE here.
