;;; Computing the class precedence list

;;; This relation is represented as a list of cons cells,
;;; where the class in the CAR of the cell takes precedence over
;;; the class in the CDR of the cell. For a class C with a list of

;;; the elements (C . S1) (S1 . S2) ... (Sn-1 . Sn).

;;; Default action for the primary method on COMPUTE-SLOTS.
;;;
;;; The AMOP says that this function returns the resulting list of
;;; slots in an "unspecified order".  Analyzing the text of the AMOP a
;;; bit more, we understand that the order can be specified by the
;;; implementation, that this order determines the LOCATION of each
;;; directly accessible slot in that the default :AROUND method on
;;; COMPUTE-SLOTS allocates locations with increasing locations
;;; according to this order.
;;;
;;; Here, we want the slots to appear in an instance with slots
;;; defined in more general classes first, so that is what this
;;; function does.
;;;
;;; The AMOP says that lists of direct slot definitions are grouped by
;;; name into separate lists, and that each list is then sorted
;;; according to the class precedence list.  However, we can not use
;;; CLASS-PRECEDENCE-LIST to access the precedence list, because the
;;; AMOP also stipulates that this function signals an error if the
;;; class is not finalized, and computing the effective slots is part
;;; of the class finalization protocol.  For that reason, we use the
;;; alternative reader PRECEDENCE-LIST that works just like the normal
;;; CLASS-PRECEDENCE-LIST, except that it just accesses the slot, and
;;; does not signal an error if the class has not been finalized.
;;;
;;; The AMOP does not say what is supposed to happen if this generic
;;; function is called if the class precedence list has not first been
;;; computed and made available.  Here (at least for now), we make the
;;; assumption that the application programmer is not supposed to call
;;; this function directly, so that it is only called from
;;; FINALIZE-INHERITANCE, and that the application programmer is only
;;; allowed to write methods on it.

;;; probably use the class precedence list directly to sort the direct
;;; slot definitions within a list with the same slot name.

;;; FINALIZE-INHERITANCE.
;;;
;;; The AMOP says that class finalization is done in three steps:
;;;
;;;   1. Compute the class precedence list and associate it with the
;;;      class so that it is returned by CLASS-PRECEDENCE-LIST.
;;;
;;;   2. Compute the effective slots and associate them with the
;;;      class, so that they are returned by CLASS-SLOTS.
;;;
;;;   3. Compute the default initargs and associate them with the
;;;      class, so that they are returned by CLASS-DEFAULT-INIARGS.
;;;
;;; The problem with this scenario is that steps 2 and 3 would call
;;; CLASS-PRECEDENCE-LIST to access the class precedence list computed
;;; in step 1.  However, the AMOP also specifies that the generic
;;; function CLASS-PRECEDENCE-LIST signals an error if the class is
;;; not finalized, which it will not be until step 3 is completed!
;;;
;;; The only solution we can see is for steps 2 and 3 to access the
;;; class precedence list using way other than calling the function
;;; CLASS-PRECEDENCE-LIST; either with a different reader, or by using
;;; SLOT-VALUE.  SLOT-VALUE is unappealing because it might be slow,
;;; so we choose the first solution, and define an ACCESSOR called
;;; PRECEDENCE-LIST.
;;;
;;; The AMOP says that ALLOCATE-INSTANCE calls CLASS-FINALIZED-P to
;;; check whether the class is finalized, and if it is not, then it
;;; calls FINALIZE-INHERITANCE.  We use this information to define
;;; FINALIZE-INHERITANCE to always finalize the class, independently
;;; of whether it is already finalized.  In the worst case, some
;;; function other than ALLOCATE-INSTANCE might forget to test whether
;;; the class is finalized before calling FINALIZE-INHERITANCE in
;;; which case nothing bad happens other than a performance
;;; degradation.
;;;
;;; The AMOP does not tell use whether the fact that a class is
;;; finalized implies that all its superclasses are finalized as well,
;;; and it MIGHT make sense to allow that.  On the other hand, all the
;;; steps involved in finalizing a class require basically the same
;;; processing in the superclasses, so we do not allow this, and
;;; instead require all the superclasses of a finalized class to be
;;; finalized as well.

;;; We define this function as a separate abstraction, because during
;;; bootstrapping, it might not necessarily be desirable to call
;;; CLASS-FINALIZED-P, and during bootstrapping, we have full control
;;; over class finalization, so we can make sure it is done so that it
;;; can be assumed that all the superclasses of some class C are all
;;; finalized before an attempt is made to finalize C itself.
