;;; ENSURE-CLASS and ENSURE-CLASS-USING-CLASS.

;;; ENSURE-CLASS is called from code resulting from the macroexpansion
;;; of a macro call to DEFCLASS, but it can also be called directly
;;; from user code.  This means that we have to be careful about
;;; default values of initialization arguments.
;;;
;;; When DEFCLASS is used, it is intended to mean that the class be
;;; defined according to the specification in DEFCLASS, with omitted
;;; options given proper defaults.  If the class already exists, and
;;; DEFCLASS is called, the intended meaning is for the class to be
;;; completely redefined according to the new specification, again
;;; with omitted options given proper defaults.  The intended meaning
;;; is NOT to redefine only the parts of the DEFCLASS specification
;;; that were explicitly given.
;;;
;;; But when ENSURE-CLASS is used directly from user code, omitting
;;; some initialization arguments may very well mean that if the class
;;; already exists, we should use the previous values.
;;;
;;; Therefore, clearly, it is safe for DEFCLASS to pass a complete set
;;; of initialization arguments to ENSURE-CLASS, but it is safe for
;;; DEFCLASS to omit some arguments to ENSURE-CLASS only if
;;; ENSURE-CLASS defaults them to the same values that DEFCLASS
;;; requires.
