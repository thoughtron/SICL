;;;; COMPUTE-APPLICABLE-METHODS and
;;;; COMPUTE-APPLICABLE-METHODS-USING-CLASSES.

;;; Determine whether a method is more specific than another method
;;; with respect to a list of classes of required arguments.
;;;
;;; Recall that whether a method is more or less specific than another
;;; method is also a function of the classes of the arguments, because
;;; the order of two classes in the class precedence list of two
;;; different argument classes can be different.
;;;
;;; This function is called only with applicable methods with respect
;;; to the classes of the arguments supplied.
;;;
;;; It is possible for two methods of a generic function to be equally
;;; specific (which then means that they have the same specializer in
;;; every required position), but then they must have different
;;; qualifiers.  This function is called with all applicable
;;; functions, independent of the qualifiers, so this situation might
;;; happen here.
