;;; At the moment, this macro does not have any compile-time side
;;; effects.

;;; CT-ENV is the compile-time environment in which the call to
;;; DEFMETHOD is compiled.  We check the compile-time environment to
;;; see whether there is a generic function named FUNCTION-NAME in it.
;;; If there is such a generic function, it is used as the first
;;; argument to MAKE-METHOD-LAMBDA, and the CLASS-PROTOTYPE of the
;;; GENERIC-FUNCTION-METHOD-CLASS of that function is used as the
;;; second argument to MAKE-METHOD-LAMBDA.  If no such generic
;;; function is found, we use the CLASS-PROTOTYPE of the class named
;;; STANDARD-GENERIC-FUNCTION in CT-ENV as the first argument to
;;; MAKE-METHOD-LAMBDA, and we use the CLASS-PROTOTYPE of the class
;;; named STANDARD-METHOD in CT-ENV as the second argument to
;;; MAKE-METHOD-LAMBDA.
;;;
;;; The expansion of this macro calls the SICL-specific function
;;; ENSURE-METHOD.  The first argument to ENSURE-METHOD is the generic
;;; function named FUNCTION-NAME in the run-time environment (and not
;;; in the compile-time environment) in which the expansion is
;;; evaluated.  The second argument to ENSURE-METHOD is the run-time
;;; environment itself.  The function ENSURE-METHOD uses the
;;; environment argument to take symbols naming specializers and to
;;; look up the corresponding classes.
