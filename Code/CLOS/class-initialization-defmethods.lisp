;;; This :AROUND method on SHARED-INITIALIZE is meant to implement the
;;; class-initialization protocol as described in the AMOP.  We define
;;; a trivial version that trampolines to an ordinary function.  That
;;; way, during bootstrapping we can have the ordinary function
;;; executed by the host and we can define special-purpose versions
;;; of this :AROUND method.  Notice that the function CALL-NEXT-METHOD
;;; is passed as an additional argument to the ordinary function.
