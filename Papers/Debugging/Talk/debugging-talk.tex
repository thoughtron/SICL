\frametitle{Context: The \sicl{} project}

https://github.com/robert-strandh/SICL

Several objectives:

\begin{itemize}
\item Create high-quality \emph{modules} for implementors of
  \commonlisp{} systems.
\item Improve existing techniques with respect to algorithms and data
  structures where possible.
\item Improve readability and maintainability of code.
\item Improve documentation.
\item Ultimately, create a new implementation based on these modules.
\item Provide excellent debugging facilities.
\item Keep system \emph{safe}.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Definition of ``safety''}
For the purpose of this work, we consider a system to be \emph{safe}
if and only if, there is no manipulation that a user can do that
violates the internal consistency of the system.
\vskip 0.25cm
We do \emph{not} include in the definition any protection against the
program giving the wrong answer as a result of incorrect programming.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Definition of ``application debugging''}
The technique described here is meant for debugging ``application
code'', as opposed to ``system code''.
\vskip 0.25cm
It is not meant for debugging system components such as the compiler.
\vskip 0.25cm
It assumes that the compiler generates code that corresponds to the
semantics of the source code.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Traditional approach: Process-based debugging}
The debugger and the application execute in separate processes with
separate address spaces.
\vskip 0.25cm
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-process-based-debugging.pdf_t}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
Used in UNIX-like systems.

Also recommended for CCL and ECL.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Traditional approach: Process-based debugging}
The instructions of the application are modified by the debugger
(using copy-on-write pages).
\vskip 0.25cm
Does not require any collaboration from the application.
\vskip 0.25cm
Additional debugging information is needed for source-level
debugging.
\vskip 0.25cm
Inherently \emph{unsafe}.  The debugger can alter any memory
location.
\vskip 0.25cm
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Same-process debugging}
Has many advantages in the context of \commonlisp{}.
\vskip 0.25cm
Introduces several problems that must be solved.
\vskip 0.25cm
Setting a breakpoint in a function used by the evaluator or the
debugger may render the system useless.
\vskip 0.25cm
Unsafe operations may crash the system or, worse, silently give the
wrong answer.

}

\frame{
\frametitle{Debugging in FLOSS \commonlisp{} implementations}
Inferior or non-existing debugging support.
\vskip 0.25cm
The \texttt{trace} facility of most implementations uses
\emph{encapsulation}.
\vskip 0.25cm
Many implementations do not have a working \texttt{step} facility.
\vskip 0.25cm
ECL accomplishes stepping with a special instruction type in the
bytecode virtual machine.
\vskip 0.25cm
SBCL has breakpoints, but they are used only for the \texttt{trace}
facility.  Stepping is accomplished using the condition system, and
only when the \texttt{debug} quality is sufficiently high.

}

\frame{
\frametitle{Debugging in LispWorks}
Breakpoints can be set from the editor or the stepper.
\vskip 0.25cm
The first time a breakpoint is set, the source code of the defining
form is re-evaluated with additional annotations for the stepper.
\vskip 0.25cm
If a breakpoint is encountered, the stepper is automatically invoked
if it is not invoked already.
\vskip 0.25cm
Setting a breakpoint requires source code, so no breakpoints possible
in system code.
\vskip 0.25cm
The \texttt{trace} facility uses encapsulation.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Debugging in Allegro}
The most complete system of them all.
\vskip 0.25cm
Breakpoints alter native code, in a way similar to process-based
debugging.
\vskip 0.25cm
To avoid an unusable system, when a breakpoint is encountered, the
debugger first \emph{uninstalls} all breakpoints.
\vskip 0.25cm
This low-level mechanism is used for stepping, source-level debugging,
tracing, etc.
\vskip 0.25cm
The mechanism is inherently unsafe (with our definition of safety).
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Our technique}
The compiler always includes two versions of each function body:
\vskip 0.25cm
\begin{itemize}
\item One version containing ``normal'', optimized code.
\item One version containing debugging code.
\end{itemize}
\vskip 0.25cm
This idea is due to Michael Raskin.
\vskip 0.25cm
The debugging version contains code for collaboration with the
\emph{debugger}.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Our technique}
The two different versions are accessible through different
\emph{entry points} to the function:
\vskip 0.25cm
\begin{itemize}
\item A function call in the normal version invokes the normal entry
  point of the callee.
\item A function call in the debugging version invokes the debugging
  entry point of the callee.
\end{itemize}
\vskip 0.25cm
Therefore, debugging does not have any overhead in normal code.
\vskip 0.25cm
This idea is due to Frode Fjeld.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Our technique}
The debugger and the application run in the same process, but in
different \emph{threads}.
\vskip 0.25cm
When the application is invoked from the debugger, the debugging entry
point is called.
\vskip 0.25cm
This technique makes it possible to set breakpoints in system code,
and even in debugger code.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Our technique, breakpoints}
In the debugging version of a function, the compiler inserts a test
immediately before and immediately after the evaluation of each form.
\vskip 0.25cm
This test consults a table indexed with values of the program counter.
\vskip 0.25cm
The table indicates whether there is a breakpoint at this location.
\vskip 0.25cm
This table is managed by the debugger.
\vskip 0.25cm
A shared \emph{queue} is provided for communication.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Our technique, breakpoints}
\vskip 0.25cm
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-thread-based-debugging-1.pdf_t}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The user sets breakpoints using debugger commands.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Our technique, breakpoints}
\vskip 0.25cm
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-thread-based-debugging-2.pdf_t}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The application consults table before/after each form.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Our technique, breakpoints}
\vskip 0.25cm
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-thread-based-debugging-3.pdf_t}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
At a breakpoint, the application first informs the debugger.
}

\vskip 0.25cm
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-thread-based-debugging-4.pdf_t}

It then blocks from reading from the empty queue.

\vskip 0.25cm
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-thread-based-debugging-5.pdf_t}

The user examines data and sets/clears breakpoints.

\vskip 0.25cm
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-thread-based-debugging-6.pdf_t}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The debugger writes to the queue, unblocking the application.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Our technique, stepping}
Stepping is accomplished by temporary breakpoints inserted by the debugger.
\vskip 0.25cm
The user can choose different places to step to
\begin{itemize}
\item In to an expression.
\item Out of an expression.
\item Over an expression.
\item Into a function being called.
\item Out of the current function being invoked.
\end{itemize}
\vskip 0.25cm
The debugger removes the breakpoint from the table, once encountered.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Our technique, tracing}
Tracing inserts a breakpoint, marked as a trace point.
\vskip 0.25cm
When a trace point is encountered, the debugger prints
a message, and then immediately unblocks the application.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Our technique, benefits}
Safety.  The debugger does not alter the application code.
\vskip 0.25cm
No wire protocol.  Simplified communication.
\vskip 0.25cm
No disadvantages due to encapsulation for tracing.
\vskip 0.25cm
No need to recompile with a higher \texttt{debug} value in order to
debug the application.
\vskip 0.25cm
The full-speed version is used by other threads, so no performance
degradation in those threads.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Our technique, disadvantages}
Code size will more than double.
\vskip 0.25cm
Incompatibility with existing \commonlisp{} implementations.
}
\frame{
\frametitle{Our technique, current state}
Embryonic implementation of the communication protocol.
\vskip 0.25cm
Embryonic CLIM-based debugger called Clordane.
}


\frame{
\frametitle{Future work}
Modify the SICL compiler to generate two versions of every function
body.
\vskip 0.25cm
Try using the portable library for adding debugging annotations to
arbitrary code, written by Michael Raskin for implementing/testing
communication between the debugger and the application.
\vskip 0.25cm
Implement the rest of Clordane.

(Allegro).
\vskip 0.25cm
We would like to thank Frode Fjeld for giving feedback on early
versions of this paper, and for suggesting the use of multiple entry
points for each function.
\vskip 0.25cm
We would like to thank Michael Raskin for suggesting that two versions
of each function should be provided, thereby making it unnecessary for
the programmer to choose the level of debugging.
